Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System for Delhi Transport Corporation
Background: Efficient bus scheduling and route planning are essential for the smooth operation of public bus transport services. Currently, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) relies on manual methods for scheduling and planning, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance service reliability, DTC needs an automated software solution capable of handling both linked and unlinked duty scheduling. Additionally, the solution should facilitate route management by mapping all existing routes and highlighting overlaps with proposed new routes. This project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution to streamline bus scheduling, optimize resource utilization, and improve route planning. Detailed Description: The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System will utilize lgorithms, data analytics, and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to automate various aspects of bus scheduling and route management. The system will potentially include (but not limited to) features such as: Linked Duty Scheduling: Assign a specific crew to a bus at the start of their duty, ensuring they remain with the bus throughout their shift. Provide tools to manage and monitor crew and bus assignments for better familiarity and accountability. Unlinked Duty Scheduling: Allow crews to hand over buses to other crew members after assigned completing their trips. Manage rest periods for crew menbers and after their reassign them to different buses rest period. Route Management: Map all existing routes and provide a visual representation of the bus network. Enable users to draw new routes and automatically highlight overlaps with existing routes. Optimize route planning to reduce congestion and improve service coverage. Expected Output: A fully functional prototype of the Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System demonstrating the above features through the integration of algorithms, data analytics, and GIS technologies. The system will offer a user-friendly interface for schedulers, planners, and managers to interact with the system, manage schedules, plan routes, and access real-time data and reports.
